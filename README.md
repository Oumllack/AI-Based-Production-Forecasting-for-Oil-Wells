# AI-Based Oil Production Forecasting: A Comprehensive Machine Learning Approach

## Abstract
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of machine learning models for oil production forecasting using synthetic well data. We evaluate multiple models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Prophet, comparing their performance in predicting daily oil production rates. Our analysis reveals that the Prophet model significantly outperforms other approaches, achieving an R² score of 0.893, demonstrating its superior capability in capturing both trend and seasonality in oil production data.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Oil production forecasting is crucial for reservoir management, production planning, and economic evaluation. Traditional methods often rely on decline curve analysis and reservoir simulation, which can be computationally intensive and require detailed reservoir characterization. Machine learning approaches offer an alternative that can potentially provide faster and more accurate predictions using historical production data.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models for oil production forecasting
- Compare model performance using both statistical metrics and visual analysis
- Identify the most effective approach for short and medium-term production forecasting
- Provide insights into the factors influencing production rates

## 6. Conclusion
This study demonstrates that time series-specific models, particularly Prophet, are more effective for oil production forecasting than traditional machine learning approaches. The results suggest that capturing temporal patterns and seasonality is crucial for accurate predictions.
